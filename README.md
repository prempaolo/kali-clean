# Custom Kali config

Custom configurations for Kali VM. There are 3 main scripts for different uses:
1. `install_lf.sh` to automatically install and configure lf
2. `kali-clean.sh` to configure Kali with DWM and custom configurations
3. `configure_kali.sh` to configure Kali with i3 and some basic configurations (use this for a lightweight customization)
